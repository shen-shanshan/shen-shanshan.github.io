Hello, I am currently a software engineer working at [Huawei Ascend](https://www.hiascend.com/), engaging in AI Infra and LLM. I have contributed to some open-source projects such as [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) and [ChatTTS](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS), to build a easy-to-use software ecosystem for Ascend. Before this, I was a student at [Beijing Jiao Tong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/) (BSc/MSc), majoring in communication engineering. You can see more projects at my [Github](https://github.com/shen-shanshan), or see my posts at [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44162047?type=blog) and [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/sss-53-26).
